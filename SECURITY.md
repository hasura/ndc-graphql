## Reporting a Vulnerability

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the community.
All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in the GraphQL connector or related components.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the connector.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that connector depends on (e.g. Docker, etc).
- You want to report any other security risk that could potentially harm connector users.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help applying security-related updates.
- Your issue is not security-related.

### Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the project's maintainers. New pull requests are welcome too.
